# ðŸ§Š Asv.Mavlink

## Introduction

The [`asv-mavlink`](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-mavlink) library provides a robust interface for communication with MAVLink compatible vehicles and payloads. This library is designed to facilitate the interaction with drones and other devices using the MAVLink protocol, enabling users to send commands, receive telemetry data, and perform various operations.

Additionally, the library includes a CLI utility [Asv.Mavlink.Shell](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-mavlink/tree/main/src/Asv.Mavlink.Shell) for simulating, testing and code generation.

This library is part of the open-source cross-platform application for drones [Asv Drones](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-drones).

## Installation

To install the [`asv-mavlink`](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-mavlink) library, you can use the following command:

```
dotnet add package Asv.Mavlink --version <Version>
```

## Documentation
